    "text": "Hi! My name is Mustafa Alp. I am junior at Hacettepe University. I am trying to finish my Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Engineering. I like playing football. When I was a child, I was playing football in local team which is Akdeniz Timsahlari in Alanya. This team is a pilot team of Bursa Spor Football Club. Also, I like playing table tennis, Professor Dr. Murat Caner TESTIK confirms that I play table tennis well :). In addition, I am interested in biking but extreme one. It is called “Downhill” or “Urban Downhill”. I like playing online games which are fps games on pc. I am a pc gamer by the way. If the subject is industrial engineering, I love Industrial Engineering. When I was 10 years old, I decided that I would become an industrial engineer when I grew up. So that, I chose Industrial Engineering English program of Hacettepe University. I loved Operation Research and Programming Application. But I can say that, I don’t like Probability and Statistic Topics. But I have to know. This is my summary in briefly. Have a nice day :)\n\n\n\n Back to top"

He talked about his academic achievements, work experiences and hobbies. He talked about the projects that took part in. He mentioned that he was both the owner and developer of a program called Supply Chain Solver. Secondly, he talked about data analytics world. He divided the analytics world in four pieces such as Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive. He even compared Prescriptive Analytics to a doctor writing a prescription.He related the data analytics world pieces to the industrial engineering courses and emphasized the importance of these relationships. Thirdly, he talked about analytical solutions and methods. He gave some examples which is given at daily life about analytical methods. In addition, he talked about his obtainments. He recommended defining the problem first in all cases. He suggested that if I was developing a model, I should share that model with people. He said that staying on the computer would not be beneficial. He said that if I am doing a job, I have to present it in a language that everyone can understand. He said that after all the work, it would be useful to go back to problem definition. Finally, He answered questions from students such as Aykut.\nFirst Question\n\nCan you give an example of the Descriptive-&gt;Predictive-&gt;Prescriptive process from your daily life?\n\nAnswer: “Daily Inventory Level -&gt; Demand Forecast -&gt; Safety Stock Optimization” or “Mortgage Application -&gt; Applicant’s Loan Score Estimation -&gt; Mortgage Decision”\nSecond Question\n\nWhat is KPI short for?\n\n\n\nKey Personalizing Index\nKit Personal intensiveness\nKey Performance Indicator (This is the answer)\nKnot Pair Import",

I used is.na function. I knew this function from lecture slides and Aykut’s Website. (By the way, Aykut’s Website is superfly)\n\ntotal_number_of_none_available &lt;- sum(is.na(polls_us_election_2016))\nprint(total_number_of_none_available)\n\n[1] 11604\n\n\nFourth Step\nTask 4: Replace all NA values with my first name and my birth year. First of all, I defined two variable which are my first name and my birth year. Secondly, I defined a function which is recursive function type. This function???s mission is to evaluate of data variables equal to NA value or not for factor columns and this function has ???for loop??? with if-else statement for checking all columns and changing NA values. This function changed all NA values in numeric columns, character columns and factor columns with my birth yera and my first name. Function returns the data in the end of loop. Finally, I assigned a variable which is equal to changed data by this function. In this part, I take some helps from slides, AI tools, datacamp lectures and friends about loop structure, function structure, use of if-else statement, use of return statement, use of squared brackets and use of levels function. Especially, I used AI on using for loop. I know for loops structure, but using if-else and functions inside each other in the for loop structure was very difficult for me. Recursive function idea was coming from my mind after 20 or 30 trials. Most of my error is state values changed by numeric value. I still don’t understand why I’m getting an error.\n\nbirth_year &lt;- 2003\nfirst_name &lt;- \"Mustafa\"\n\n\nreplace_na_general &lt;- function(data, birth_year, first_name) {\n  \n  \n  replace_na_in_factor &lt;- function(factor_col, replacement) {\n    levels(factor_col) &lt;- c(levels(factor_col), replacement) \n    factor_col[is.na(factor_col)] &lt;- replacement             \n    return(factor_col)\n  }\n  \n  \n  for (col in names(data)) {\n    if (is.numeric(data[[col]])) {\n      \n      data[[col]][is.na(data[[col]])] &lt;- birth_year\n    } else if (is.character(data[[col]])) {\n      \n      data[[col]][is.na(data[[col]])] &lt;- first_name\n    } else if (is.factor(data[[col]])) {\n      \n      data[[col]] &lt;- replace_na_in_factor(data[[col]], first_name)\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return(data)\n}\n\nmodified_data &lt;- replace_na_general(polls_us_election_2016, birth_year, first_name)\n\nI checked in step five whether the code worked or not.\nFifth Step\nTask 5: Print the first 10 rows of the new data frame and the total number of NAs remaining in the new data frame. In this step, I checked the code about working correctly. If the result is equal to 0, we have no NA values. They have all changed. I remember we did this kind of check in class. I used head function again for new data.\n\ntotal_na_number_new &lt;- sum(is.na(modified_data))\nprint(total_na_number_new)\n\n[1] 0\n\nhead(modified_data, 10)\n\n        state  startdate    enddate\n1        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n2        U.S. 2016-11-01 2016-11-07\n3        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n4        U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n5        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n6        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n7        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n8        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-05\n9  New Mexico 2016-11-06 2016-11-06\n10       U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n                                                     pollster   grade\n1                                    ABC News/Washington Post      A+\n2                                     Google Consumer Surveys       B\n3                                                       Ipsos      A-\n4                                                      YouGov       B\n5                                            Gravis Marketing      B-\n6  Fox News/Anderson Robbins Research/Shaw & Company Research       A\n7                                     CBS News/New York Times      A-\n8                                NBC News/Wall Street Journal      A-\n9                                                    Zia Poll Mustafa\n10                                                   IBD/TIPP      A-\n   samplesize population rawpoll_clinton rawpoll_trump rawpoll_johnson\n1        2220         lv           47.00         43.00            4.00\n2       26574         lv           38.03         35.69            5.46\n3        2195         lv           42.00         39.00            6.00\n4        3677         lv           45.00         41.00            5.00\n5       16639         rv           47.00         43.00            3.00\n6        1295         lv           48.00         44.00            3.00\n7        1426         lv           45.00         41.00            5.00\n8        1282         lv           44.00         40.00            6.00\n9        8439         lv           46.00         44.00            6.00\n10       1107         lv           41.20         42.70            7.10\n   rawpoll_mcmullin adjpoll_clinton adjpoll_trump adjpoll_johnson\n1              2003        45.20163      41.72430        4.626221\n2              2003        43.34557      41.21439        5.175792\n3              2003        42.02638      38.81620        6.844734\n4              2003        45.65676      40.92004        6.069454\n5              2003        46.84089      42.33184        3.726098\n6              2003        49.02208      43.95631        3.057876\n7              2003        45.11649      40.92722        4.341786\n8              2003        43.58576      40.77325        5.365788\n9              2003        44.82594      41.59978        7.870127\n10             2003        42.92745      42.23545        6.316175\n   adjpoll_mcmullin\n1              2003\n2              2003\n3              2003\n4              2003\n5              2003\n6              2003\n7              2003\n8              2003\n9              2003\n10             2003",

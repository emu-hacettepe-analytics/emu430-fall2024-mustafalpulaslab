I am trying to finish my Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Engineering. I like playing football. When I was a child, I was playing football in local team which is Akdeniz Timsahlari in Alanya. This team is a pilot team of Bursa Spor Football Club. Also, I like playing table tennis, Professor Dr. Murat Caner TESTIK confirms that I play table tennis well :). In addition, I am interested in biking but extreme one. It is called “Downhill” or “Urban Downhill”. I like playing online games which are fps games on pc. I am a pc gamer by the way. If the subject is industrial engineering, I love Industrial Engineering. When I was 10 years old, I decided that I would become an industrial engineer when I grew up. So that, I chose Industrial Engineering English program of Hacettepe University. I loved Operation Research and Programming Application. But I can say that, I don’t like Probability and Statistic Topics. But I have to know. This is my summary in briefly. Have a nice day :)"

He talked about his academic achievements, work experiences and hobbies. He talked about the projects that took part in. He mentioned that he was both the owner and developer of a program called Supply Chain Solver. Secondly, he talked about data analytics world. He divided the analytics world in four pieces such as Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive. He even compared Prescriptive Analytics to a doctor writing a prescription.He related the data analytics world pieces to the industrial engineering courses and emphasized the importance of these relationships. Thirdly, he talked about analytical solutions and methods. He gave some examples which is given at daily life about analytical methods. In addition, he talked about his obtainments. He recommended defining the problem first in all cases. He suggested that if I was developing a model, I should share that model with people. He said that staying on the computer would not be beneficial. He said that if I am doing a job, I have to present it in a language that everyone can understand. He said that after all the work, it would be useful to go back to problem definition. Finally, He answered questions from students such as Aykut.\nFirst Question\n\nCan you give an example of the Descriptive-&gt;Predictive-&gt;Prescriptive process from your daily life?\n\nAnswer: “Daily Inventory Level -&gt; Demand Forecast -&gt; Safety Stock Optimization” or “Mortgage Application -&gt; Applicant’s Loan Score Estimation -&gt; Mortgage Decision”\nSecond Question\n\nWhat is KPI short for?\n\n\n\nKey Personalizing Index\nKit Personal intensiveness\nKey Performance Indicator (This is the answer)\nKnot Pair Import",

I used is.na function. I knew this function from lecture slides and Aykut’s Website. (By the way, Aykut’s Website is superfly)\n\ntotal_number_of_none_available &lt;- sum(is.na(polls_us_election_2016))\nprint(total_number_of_none_available)\n\n[1] 11604\n\n\nFourth Step\nTask 4: Replace all NA values with my first name and my birth year. First of all, I must define two variable which are my first name and my birth year. Then, I have to define a function which is evaluate of data variables equal to NA value or not. I take some help from your’s slides about function structure. Thirdly, I must replace NA values with my name and my birth year by using my function, as.data.frame and lapply function. I take some help from AI tool about lappy function and usage. Also I found lappy function from Google by searching such as replacing function in R. I used lecture slides and datacamp lessons. As you said, I stated where and how I received help. Finally, store the modified data set as a new object.\n\nmy_birth_year &lt;- 2003\nmy_first_name &lt;- \"Mustafa\"\n\nreplace_na_function &lt;- function(x) {\n  if (is.numeric(x)) {\n    return(ifelse(is.na(x), my_birth_year, x))  \n  } else {\n    return(ifelse(is.na(x), my_first_name, x))\n  }\n}\n\npolls_us_election_2016 &lt;- as.data.frame(lapply(polls_us_election_2016, replace_na_function))\n\nmodified_data &lt;- polls_us_election_2016\n\nI checked in step five whether the code worked or not.\nFifth Step\nTask 5: Print the first 10 rows of the new data frame and the total number of NAs remaining in the new data frame. In this step, I check the code about working correctly. If the result is equal to 0, we have no NA values. They have all changed. I remember we did this kind of check in class. I used head function again for new data.\n\ntotal_number_of_na_for_modified &lt;- sum(is.na(modified_data))\nprint(total_number_of_na_for_modified)\n\n[1] 0\n\nhead(modified_data, 10)\n\n   state startdate enddate pollster   grade samplesize population\n1     50     17108   17111        1      10       2220         lv\n2     50     17106   17112       63       6      26574         lv\n3     50     17107   17111       81       8       2195         lv\n4     50     17109   17112      194       6       3677         lv\n5     50     17108   17111       65       5      16639         rv\n6     50     17108   17111       55       9       1295         lv\n7     50     17107   17111       18       8       1426         lv\n8     50     17108   17110      113       8       1282         lv\n9     37     17111   17111      195 Mustafa       8439         lv\n10    50     17109   17112       76       8       1107         lv\n   rawpoll_clinton rawpoll_trump rawpoll_johnson rawpoll_mcmullin\n1            47.00         43.00            4.00             2003\n2            38.03         35.69            5.46             2003\n3            42.00         39.00            6.00             2003\n4            45.00         41.00            5.00             2003\n5            47.00         43.00            3.00             2003\n6            48.00         44.00            3.00             2003\n7            45.00         41.00            5.00             2003\n8            44.00         40.00            6.00             2003\n9            46.00         44.00            6.00             2003\n10           41.20         42.70            7.10             2003\n   adjpoll_clinton adjpoll_trump adjpoll_johnson adjpoll_mcmullin\n1         45.20163      41.72430        4.626221             2003\n2         43.34557      41.21439        5.175792             2003\n3         42.02638      38.81620        6.844734             2003\n4         45.65676      40.92004        6.069454             2003\n5         46.84089      42.33184        3.726098             2003\n6         49.02208      43.95631        3.057876             2003\n7         45.11649      40.92722        4.341786             2003\n8         43.58576      40.77325        5.365788             2003\n9         44.82594      41.59978        7.870127             2003\n10        42.92745      42.23545        6.316175             2003",
